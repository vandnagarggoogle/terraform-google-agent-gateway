# Google Network Services Agent Gateway Module

This module deploys a `google_network_services_agent_gateway` resource in a specified GCP project. This gateway is used to integrate with authorization policies and extensions.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use this module:

```terraform
module "my_agent_gateway" {
  source = "./modules/agent_gateway" # Or use a Git/GCS source

  project_id      = "your-gcp-project-id"
  gateway_name    = "my-secure-agent-gateway"
  display_name    = "My Company Agent Gateway"
  # location      = "global" # Defaults to "global"

  # Optional: Associate with pre-existing Authz Policy and Extension
  # authz_policy_id   = "my-authz-policy-id"
  # authz_extension_id = "my-authz-extension-id"

  labels = {
    environment = "dev"
    managed-by  = "terraform"
  }
}

# Example of referencing outputs
output "gateway_id" {
  value = module.my_agent_gateway.agent_gateway_id
}
